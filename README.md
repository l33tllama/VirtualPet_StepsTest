# VirtualPet_StepsTest
Raspberry Pi Pico Vritual Pet test.  

This is PlatformIO Arduino code for the Raspberry Pi Pico.  

It displays step counts on an 8x8 LED Matrix display using the adafruit LED backpack library and MPU6050 library by electroniccats.  

Just testing the functionality of the LED matrix display and MPU6050, and the ability to count steps, which will be useful for the virtual pet project I am working on.
